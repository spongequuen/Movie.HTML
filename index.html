    <!-- üîπ Introduction -->
    <p>
      <b>The Lion King</b> is a Disney animated film released in 1994. It tells
      the story of Simba, a young lion prince who must find his courage to
      reclaim his place as king after the tragic loss of his father, Mufasa, who
      is murdered by his uncle Scar, who then blames the cub for the death.
      Along the way, Simba learns about responsibility, friendship, and the true
      meaning of the circle of life.

      The opening song, <b>"Circle of Life"</b>, became so iconic that the
      sunrise scene is now considered one of the greatest openings in film
      history.
